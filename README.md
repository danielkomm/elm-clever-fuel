# elm-clever-fuel

Welcome to my gas stations price comparator "CLEVER-FUEL" built with Elm!  
I'm using the  free plans from the [Tankk√∂nig-Api](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/?page=info) and [PTV-Developer-Api](https://developer.myptv.com/Documentation/Geocoding%20API/QuickStart.htm)

## How to run the Project
Open the project and run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
elm make src/Main.elm --output elm.js && mv elm.js ./src/
```
It's important that the generated ```elm.js``` file is in the ```src``` directory. 

After you run the command, you can simply open the ```index.html``` file. :)

For the development I used VS-Code.

```Have fun!```
